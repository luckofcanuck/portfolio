###My Portfolio

This is not just a collection of my best work, but an exhibition of it as well. This app was built in AngularJS originally, as it was the framework I learned for full-stack development in my dev boot camp. However, in the final week of my program, I took it upon myself (alongside two classmates) to learn Angular 4 so we could be confident in component based development before moving on from our schooling. 

Two weeks after writing my first line of an app in Angular 4, this site was deployed. This portfolio describes me, what I do, what projects I have most recently (and/or most proudly) completed, how to get in touch of me, and all of that while being, in itself, a statement as to how quickly I can jump into a new technology and confidently build with it. 

This application is fully responsive, has nesting components, and uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
